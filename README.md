# ACI-Health
A hardware based "monitor" for Cisco ACI infrastructure.

### What does it do?
 Let's start with a short description of what the device does. It's designed to show current "health status" of ACI infrastructure. Using the API it "reads" the current "System Health" score of the fabric and displays it on a 4x8 LED multicolour display. The "size" and colour of the display will reflect the health score of the fabric.

 In the first example we see that if the health score is "100" all rows, starting from bottom lit up in green. As the health score decreases the number of lit up rows decreases at the same time the colour changes, by the time the health score reaches 25, only two rows lit up red and so on.

### What are the use cases? 
 The device is a prof of concept. The "vision" for this device is to be installed in for example CTO's office, so that he/she can have a quick view of the organisation's datacenter network status without having to login to a computer/phone or any other device. Just a quick "glance" at the display will reveal the network status.
 It's also a great example of the flexibility of API built into the ACI product. I personally use it as a demo device when presenting ACI to customers, it serves a "monitoring" function telling me if the fabric is "ready for another demo".
     
### How it's done?

#### Hardware.
 The device is based on "Raspberry Pi Zero" embedded linux computer. The computer uses a wi-fi dongle plugged via a USB hub to connect to wireless network. The "screen" is an of-the-shelf available module. Power is provided via a micro USB cable (either from a "phone" style charger or using a USB-A-to-micro-USB cable plugged to a computer).
Here is where you can source the HW from:

1. Raspberry Pi Zero W and ~~WiFi dongle~~.

2. USB HUB (not needed anymore if you use raspberry pi zero w)

**Edit (Oct-2019)**. Those days you can of course use the raspberry pi zero w, with WiFi built in. So no need for USB HUB as well.
And why not use ESP8266 you ask? Well getting the Enterprise wireless configuration on ESP type device was challenging last time I tried, embedded linux deals with it much better so for this project I stick to raspberry pi.

#### Software.
 The code that controls the gadget is written in python and the main monitoring script (monitor.py) is called on boot of the raspberry pi. I'm not a python guru so don't expect amazing code :) It's a good starting point for experiments with the API built into ACI.
 
Full instructions on how to setup from blank image are included in setup_pi_monitor file

### New Features.

#### IP address display.
 I've updated the monitor.py script, on boot the script now waits for ip address to be assigned to the device and after that it will display the ip address encoded in binary !  Fist column is the first octet, 2nd column is 2nd octet and so on. Best is to take a picture and decode later using google or calculator.
 
See example below on how to decode the ip address from what is displayed:

#### 3D Printed Case
 Added to the repository stl files, in case you would like to print your own case. The final version also has a printed label on sticky paper (covered with transparent film).
